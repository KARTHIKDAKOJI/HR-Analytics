# 🧩Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze employee attrition, i.e., to determine the number of employees leaving the company and uncover the underlying reasons behind their exit. This forms a core component of HR Analytics.

# 📁Data Source
File Type: CSV

The dataset includes information about employee demographics, job roles, education, satisfaction scores, salary, and other attributes relevant to understanding attrition.

# ✅Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
These KPIs offer a high-level summary of the workforce and attrition status:

Total Employees

Total Attrition (Number of Employees Left)

Attrition Rate (%)

Average Years at Company

Average Age

Average Monthly Salary

# 🧹Data Cleaning Process
Data cleaning was conducted using Power Query Editor in Power BI. The following steps were performed:

Identified and handled missing, error, and duplicate values.

Standardized inconsistent entries (e.g., "Travel_Rarely" vs. "TravelRarely").

Validated data types for each column.

Removed inappropriate columns (e.g., “Years with Manager”).
